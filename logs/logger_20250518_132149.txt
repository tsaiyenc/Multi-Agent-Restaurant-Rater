2025-05-18 13:26:37 - DEBUG - The overall score for McDonald's based on the reviews is low, primarily due to persistent complaints about customer service. Here are some summarized insights from the reviews:

- Food Quality: 
  - Generally rated as average to mediocre, with descriptors like "forgettable," "uninspiring," and "nothing special" used frequently.
- Customer Service: 
  - Consistently criticized as unpleasant, with mentions of "disinterested" and "rude" staff, long wait times, and overall poor service experiences.

Due to these factors, the overall impression of McDonald's from the reviews can be considered below average.
