2025-05-16 21:56:01 - DEBUG - The overall sentiment from the reviews for McDonald's is largely negative, especially concerning customer service. Here’s a summary based on the collected reviews:

### Overview of Reviews:
- **Food Quality**: Generally described as average to forgettable, with terms like "nothing special," "uninspiring," and "passable" frequently mentioned. Some reviews noted greasy burgers and soggy fries.
- **Customer Service**: Consistently highlighted as unpleasant. Frequent complaints include long wait times, disinterested staff, and a generally unfriendly demeanor from employees.

### Overall Score Assessment:
While explicit numerical scores are not provided in the reviews, the negative mentions about customer service indicate that this aspect significantly drags down the overall experience. Therefore, it can be inferred that the overall score for McDonald's would be below average due to the poor customer service, despite the food being fair or average.

If you need a specific score assigned based on the qualitative review analysis, it might be around **2 out of 5**.
