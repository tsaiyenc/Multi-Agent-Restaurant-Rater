2025-05-16 22:09:12 - DEBUG - ------------------------------
2025-05-16 22:09:12 - DEBUG - The overall reviews for McDonald's suggest a generally mediocre experience. Here's a summary of the feedback:

- **Food Quality:** The food is consistently described as average, uninspiring, or forgettable. Reviews mention that the burgers are often greasy or not warm enough, and that there are no standout menu options.

- **Customer Service:** The customer service is frequently criticized as unpleasant or poor, with many reports of long wait times and staff that seem disinterested or unfriendly.

Given this feedback, the overall score for McDonald's may be considered low due to the consistent mention of poor service despite the food being average.
